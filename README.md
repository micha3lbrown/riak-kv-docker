# Riak KV
This repo is meant to provide a deeper understanding of how Riak functions from a replication level.

## Todos
Things I'd like to demonstrate:
- [ ] `allow_mult`: Transition from Last Write Wins to allowing multiple records and then demonstrate how to resolve sibling conflicts
- [ ] What multicluster replication looks like with bidirectional `fullsync`.
